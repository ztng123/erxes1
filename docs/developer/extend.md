Erxes app can be extended by using our Graphql API or by forking the codebase.

### Extension Methods

**GRAPHQL API**

Erxes app is a great platform to work but if you want to build your own application, it is possible to use our open-source [Graphql API](https://github.com/erxes/erxes-api).

**FORK**

Erxes app is open-source, which means you have the ability to fork the [source code](https://github.com/erxes).
